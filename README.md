### By Caleb Caulk, Olivia Buhr, Daniel Breki Baldursson, DÃ¡niel Veress

We are given a dataset and the goal of predicting whether the number of bikes should be increased or not.

Our tasks:
1. data analysis
2. process the data
3. implement models
    - Logistic regression
    - Discriminant analysis
    - K-nearest neighbor
    - Tree-based methods
    - Boosting
4. tune models
5. test and compare models
6. writing report

## Setup (env creation and package install)

<code>
    
    python -m venv env
    
    source env/bin/activate
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
</code>

## Saving new packages into requirements.txt

<code>

    pip freeze > requirements.txt
