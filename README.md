We are given a dataset and the goal of predicting whether the number of bikes should be increased or not.

Our tasks:
1. data analysis
2. process the data
3. implement models
    - Logistic regression
    - Discriminant analysis
    - K-nearest neighbor
    - Tree-based methods
    - Boosting
4. tune models
5. test and compare models
